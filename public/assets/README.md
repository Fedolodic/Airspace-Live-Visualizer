# Assets

This folder stores static icons for **Airspace Live Visualizer**.

`plane.svg` is a simple white airplane with a black outline. The app
instantiates it as the moving marker for each flight.

Open `index.html` here to preview the icon, or run the main demo from
`../index.html` using a static server:

```bash
npx serve .. -l 8000
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` to see the globe visualizer.
