# .github Folder

This directory stores GitHub-specific configuration files
such as issue and pull request templates. A small demo is
included for compliance with the folder hygiene policy.

## Demo

Open `index.html` in this folder using a simple HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 9000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:9000/.github/index.html` to see
a brief confirmation message.
